r"""
This is an implementation of the Parallel tempering based ACS.  The basic idea
is to run a number of ACST (ACS with temperature) replicas (instances) in
parallel. Each of the ACST replicas has a temperature parameter which is used
to update its active_solution. The active_solution is used in the global
pheromone update rule.

The selection of the active_solution in the ACST is based on
Metropolis-Hastings rule which in turn uses a temperature parameter and the
difference (delta) between the cost (quality) of the proposed solution and the
current active_solution.

In the PTACO each of the replicas has a different temperature level ordered
from the smallest.
The replicas with the adjacent temperature levels are allowed to exchange state
or alternatively swap temperature values. This exchange affects the search
trajectory of the ACST allowing the low-temperature replica to escape a local
minimum, while the high-temperature replica can perform a local search in the
region of the solution search space containing the current active solution. 

The exchanges are performed periodically based on a parameter.
